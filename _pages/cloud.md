Follow the first steps to work with the notebooks in the cloud:

1. Create a [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com). Head to the website and click on sign-in (upper right corner). Use your university email address and set a password.
2. Make sure you are logged into your account.
3. Go to the Notebook in this website that you want to run in the cloud and click on the Cloud icon located at the bottom right corner of your screen.
4. This should take you to the library where the notebooks are saved to.
5. Click on the notebook's line (it should highlight the whole line)![azure2]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/azure2.png).
6. Click on the clone icon and create a new library to which this will be cloned. This will allow you to have your own copy of the notebook.
