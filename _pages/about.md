# About the course

The core of this tutorial is built around the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), an interactive computational environment run in a web browser.

In this particular case we will be using the R programming language for the data exploration/analysis.

## What is R?

R is a free, open-source programming language that has very strong support for statistics. It was originally developed as an open source implementation of the [S Programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)).
It is used extensively in research and industry for areas such as data analysis, statistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, simulation, linguistics and much more.

With over [8000 freely available add-on packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) that provide extensive additional functionality, R will probably have something that can help your research.

Don't just take our word for it though -- here's what others have to say

# Working with the material
The simplest way to enjoy these materials is to view each lesson online here. In such a case, you could follow along and write your own version of the programs to run with your local R installation.

### [Working locally]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/local_install/)

You can also **download/fork** the whole collections of Notebooks from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/trallard/BAD_days). That way you can use your local copy of the materials and follow along the course and make your own modifications/extensions.

<!-- Place this tag where you want the button to render. -->
<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/trallard/BAD_days/fork" data-icon="octicon-repo-forked" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Fork trallard/BAD_days on GitHub">Fork</a>

If you plan to follow this approach and run the notebooks locally (in your own desktop/laptop) make sure to follow the steps detailed in [Setting up R and Jupyter notebooks locally]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/local_install/)

### [Working on the cloud]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/cloud/)
