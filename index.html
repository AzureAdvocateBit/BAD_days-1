The Bioinformatics Awareness Days are days devoted to Bioinformatics.
As a Marie S. Curie postdoctoral fellow @ SITRaN and Computer Science Departments
at the University of Sheffield, I organized such an event to give my
practical contribution in Bioinformatics, although I have to state
that all this started in Naples at the Telethon Institute of Genetics
and Medicine, with the great Bionformatics Core.
