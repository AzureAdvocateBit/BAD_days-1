The Bioinformatics Awareness Days are days devoted to Bioinformatics. As a Marie S. Curie postdoctoral fellow @ SITRaN and Computer Science Departments at the University of Sheffield, I organized such an event to give my practical contribution in Bioinformatics, although I have to state that all this started in Naples at the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine, with the great Bionformatics Core.

Together with Tania Allard and Mike Croucher at the DCS, we decided to publicly divulgate this material to all the interested scientific community.
The sessions are self contained and a full run should last at most 2 hours.
